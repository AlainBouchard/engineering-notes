# Ways to influence people or to promote best practices:

## Using influence

- Discussions: Gather information about current pain points (retrospectives and lessons learned)
- Data-Driven solutions: show metrics of the current situation (or challenge the "no metrics" or lack of metrics); it is the also called ["Shift-Right" approach](https://github.com/AlainBouchard/testing-vision#shift-right-approach) in the Software Quality world:
  - production monitoring can be used
  - end-users or customer surveys can be used
- Involve QA Specialists in all SDLC (or [Sofware Development Life Cycle](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_overview.htm))
- 1:1 meetings to get information and expose point of views, share ideas and explain the best practices
- Talk to the teams
- Provide existing articles and blog posts
- Tech talk to expose the vision
- Create training material (guidelines, processes, videos (like Pluralsight, etc.))
- Organize Workshops (on short term) so that the targeted public becomes active participants
- Organize Work Groups (on long term) so that the concerned people become active participants

## Using authority

- Contact the best practices stakeholders and to ask for support (example: to push the best practices downward)
- To fix deadlines (must be adopted by specific dates)
