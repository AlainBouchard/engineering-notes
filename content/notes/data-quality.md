## Data Quality and Data Management 101

### What is Data Quality Definition?

- In the Data and Business Intelligence domain, Data Quality refers to the overall accuracy, completeness, reliability, and relevance of data, ensuring that it is fit for its intended use
- In essence, Data Quality ensures that the data used in business intelligence efforts is trustworthy, allowing for accurate analysis, reporting, and decision-making
- Data quality is defined by how well a given dataset meets a user's need. Data quality is an important criteria for ensuring that data-driven decisions are made as accurately as possible

### What is Data Quality Management (DQM) and its pillars?

- **People**: the involvement of the data stewards, analyst and business users who are responsible for setting data standards, monitoring quality, and resolving issues. These roles ensure alignment alignment between business needs and the data used to support them.
- **Data Profiling**: a critical step that involves analyzing the current state of the data by examining its structure, patterns, and anomalies. Data profiling helps uncover quality issues such as duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies, enabling organizations to identify areas needing improvement. It is initiated to understand the current state of existing data by comparing data to data standards as set by the DQM, used to define the benchmarks to evaluate the improvements.
- **Defining Data Quality**: establishing clear, measurable data quality dimensions such as accuracy, completeness, timeliness and consistency. These criteria are developed based on business needs and objectives, ensuring that data supports decision-making and operations effectively. What the data should look like, and it is based on the business goals
- **Data Reporting**: providing regular insights and metrics on the state of data quality through dashboards audits, and scorecards. This reporting enable stakeholders to monitor progress, identify trends, and make informed decisions about improvements and corrective actions. It will return the DQM "return on the investment" (ROI), and how data compares to the defined data quality benchmarks.
- **Data Fixing**: implementing corrective actions to resolve data quality issues, including data cleansing, standardization, and deduplication. It also involves root cause analysis to prevent recurring issues by addressing underlying process or system flaws. It is intended to repair the data that doesn't meet the defined data quality benchmarks and standards. Improving data to the required standards.

Most important pillar is probably the People one.

### What is the Impact of Poor Data Quality

Poor data quality can have significant negative impacts on a business across various dimensions:

- decision-making,
- operational efficiency,
- financial performance/missed opportunities, and
- customer trust/reputation risk.

Key impacts include:

- **Inaccurate Decision-Making**: poor data quality leads to faulty analysis and reporting, causing executives and managers to base strategic and operation decisions on incorrect or incomplete information. This can result in missed opportunities, flawed strategies, or inappropriate response to market conditions. The data based decisions and policies are only as good as the data they are based on.
- **Reduced Operational Efficiency**: when data is inaccurate or inconsistent, processes such ad data integration, analysis, and reporting take longer and require more manual intervention. This leads to inefficiencies, increased labor costs, and delayed operations, affecting productivity.
- **Financial Losses**: poor data quality can directly impact revenue by causing billing errors, incorrect pricing, or inventory mismanagement. It also increases costs due to rework compliance fines, or failed marking campaigns based on bad data. For example, failure to deliver service to customers or failure to sale the relevant contacts.
- **Customer dissatisfaction**: errors in customer data, such as wrong addresses or incorrect orders, can result in poor customer experiences, damaged relationships, and loss of trust. This can lead to increased customer churn and negative brand reputation.
- **Regulatory and Compliance risks**:: in industries with strict regulatory requirements (e.g., finance, healthcare, etc), poor data quality can lead to non-compliance, legal penalties, and damage to the organization's credibility. For example, GDPR issues and negative media coverage.
- **Loss of competitive advantage**: businesses that fail to manage data quality effectively may fall behind competitors that leverage clean, accurate data for better market insights, customer targeting, and innovation.

In conclusion, poor data quality undermines the reliability and value of business intelligence (BI)., impacting nearly every aspect of the business, from dat-to-day operations to long-term growth and competitiveness.

### Real-life Examples

There are several real-life examples where poor data quality had a significant impact on businesses:

- **Knight Capital Group**: in 2012, a software glitch caused the firm to make unintended stock trades, resulting in a $ 440 million loss within 45 minutes. This error was linked to poor data handling and led to the firm's eventual bankruptcy. [[GetRightData]]
- \*\*Boeing 747 Max Crashes: Faulty sensor data triggered the automated flight control system, contributing to two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. Boeing lost billions, and the incidents resulted in the grounding of all 737 Max planes. [[GetRightData]]
- **UK Passport Agency**: in 1999, data migration errors during a system upgrade delayed the insurance of 500K passports. The fallout from these data issues led to public outrage and a cost of around Â£12.6 millions to resolve. [[GetRightData]]
- **NASA Mars Orbiter**: NASA lost a $125 million Mars orbiter because a Lockheed Martin engineering team used English units of measurement while the agency's team used the more conventional metric system for a key spacecraft operation. [[CNN_NASA]]

These examples demonstrate how critical accurate data is in preventing financial losses, reputation damage, and even human safety risks.

More cases are documented on [[GetRightData]].

## Causes of Bad Data

Bad data can arise due to due to various reasons, typically stemming from issues in data collection, management, and governance. Here are some reasons why we encounter poor data quality:

- **Human Error**
  - **Manual Data Entry**: people can make mistakes when entering data, leading to inaccuracies, misspellings, and incomplete records. For example, typographical errors or incorrect formatting can lead to inconsistencies in databases.
  - **Lack of Training**: when data entry personnel aren't adequately trained, they may unintentionally introduce systemic errors. This happens when employees unknowingly enter incomplete or incorrect data, which accumulates and impacts the overall quality of the dataset.
- **Inadequate Data Validation**
  - **Missing Validation Rules**: without proper validation checks, systems can let through invalid data like incorrect formats or data types (for instance, entering letters when numbers are expected). These gaps can lead to faulty or unusable data being stored.
  - **Inconsistent Standards**: when different departments or systems use varying data formats and standards, it results in inconsistencies across the organization, making it difficult to maintain clean and reliable data.
- **Integration Errors**
  - **Data from Multiple Sources**: merging data from various sources, such as legacy systems or third-party vendors, often introduces discrepancies. Differences in data structures or formats can lead to duplicated records, missing information, or incorrect data being captured.
  - **Incorrect Mapping or Transformation**: during migrations or updates, if data fields aren't mapped properly, or if transformation rules are incorrect, it can lead to distorted or corrupted data.
- **Outdated Information**
  - **Stale Data**: information can become outdated if not updated regularly. This is especially common with customer records like contact details, which change frequently over time.
  - **Lag in Data Updates**: some systems don't update data in real time, leading to discrepancies between what's recorded and actual events, which can cause issues in decision-making.
- **Lack of Data Governance**
  - **No Clear Ownership**: when there's no assigned responsibility for data management, inconsistent practices across departments can result in poor data quality. Without ownership, it's hard to maintain data standards.
  - **Unstructured Data Management**: without clear policies and structured processes for managing storing, and cleaning data, its quality tends to degrade, leading to inaccurate or complete data.
- **Incomplete Data**
  - **Partial Data Entry**: sometimes, important data fields are left out during entry, leading to incomplete records. This can happen when systems don't enforce required fields, making the data unreliable.
  - **Legacy Systems**: older systems might not capture all necessary data, leaving gaps when this information i used in modern analytics or business intelligence platforms.
- **Technical Errors**
  - **System Failures**: technical issues like system crashes, corrupted files, or failed data transfers can lead to incomplete or inaccurate data.
  - **Software Bugs**: bugs in data processing tools or software can introduce errors, reading faulty data that affects overall insights and decision-making.

In conclusion, each of these factors highlights the need for solid **DQM** practices, such as robust validation, regular data cleaning, and strong governance to keep data accurate and reliable.

## Data Quality Dimensions

### Overview

**Data Quality Dimensions** refer to the different ways we measure how good our data is.

```mermaid

  DQD(Data Quality Dimensions) <--> Validity
  DQD <--> Timeliness
  DQD <--> Completeness
  DQD <--> Uniqueness
  DQD <--> Consistency
  DQD <--> Accuracy
  DQD <--> Integrity
```

Here's some of the most recognized dimensions:

- **Accuracy**: this is all about how closely the data matches real-world facts. If your data doesnât reflect reality, it can lead to bad decisions.
- **Completeness**: it checks if all the necessary information is present. Missing data can leave important gaps, making the data unreliable.
- **Consistency**: data should be the same across all systems. For example, if one database says a customer lives in New York and another says they live in California, that's inconsistent and can cause confusion.
- **Timelessness**: how current is the data? Old or delayed information can lead to missed opportunities or wrong conclusions.
- **Validity**: this looks at whether the data follows the required rules or formats. For instance, you wouldnât want letters in a field that should only have numbers.
- **Uniqueness**: there shouldnât be duplicates. If the same person or thing is entered twice, it skews the results and creates inefficiencies.
- **Integrity**: this ensures that relationships within the data are properly maintained. For example, if a customer is linked to an order, that link should always stay intact.

In summary, these dimensions help ensure that your data is trustworthy and usable for making informed business decisions.

### Example of Accuracy Issue

Hereâs an example of a **data accuracy issue** using a customer list:

| Customer ID | First Name | Last Name | Address        | City         | Zip Code |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 101         | John       | Smith     | 123 Elm St     | Springfield  | 01105    |
| 102         | Jane       | Doe       | 456 Oak Ave    | Shelbyville  | 12345    |
| 103         | Jonh       | Smtih     | 123 Elm Street | Springfield  | 1105     |
| 104         | Emma       | Johnson   | 789 Maple Blvd | Capital City | 54321    |

**Issue**:
In this table, **Customer ID 103** has multiple accuracy errors:

- **First Name**: "Jonh" should be "John."
- **Last Name**: "Smtih" should be "Smith."
- **Address**: "123 Elm Street" is an incorrect variation of "123 Elm St."
- **Zip Code**: The entry "1105" is missing a digit; it should be "01105."

These inaccuracies could lead to problems like sending mail to the wrong address, duplicate entries for the same person, or errors in customer service interactions.

This highlights how inaccurate data can cause operational inefficiencies and poor customer experiences.

### Example of Completeness Issue

Hereâs an example of a **data completeness issue** using the customer list:

| Customer ID | First Name | Last Name | Address        | City         | Zip Code |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 101         | John       | Smith     | 123 Elm St     | Springfield  | 01105    |
| 102         | Jane       | Doe       | 456 Oak Ave    | Shelbyville  | 12345    |
| 103         | Jonh       | Smtih     |                | Springfield  | 1105     |
| 104         | Emma       |           | 789 Maple Blvd | Capital City | 54321    |

**Completeness Issues**:

- **Customer 103**: The **Address** field is missing, leaving out critical information needed for communications or shipments.
- **Customer 104**: The **Last Name** is missing, making it impossible to fully identify this customer, especially if there are multiple people named "Emma."

Incomplete data like this can cause issues such as failed deliveries, incorrect customer segmentation, or difficulties in contacting the customer.

### Example of Consistency Issue

Hereâs an example of a **data consistency issue** using the customer list:

| Customer ID | First Name | Last Name | Address        | City         | Zip Code |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 101         | John       | Smith     | 123 Elm St     | Springfield  | 01105    |
| 102         | Jane       | Doe       | 456 Oak Ave    | Shelbyville  | 12345    |
| 103         | Jonh       | Smtih     | 123 Elm Street | Springfield  | 1105     |
| 104         | Emma       | Johnson   | 789 Maple Blvd | Capital City | 54321    |

**Consistency Issues**:

- **Customer 103**: The **Address** is listed as "123 Elm Street" instead of "123 Elm St," which is an inconsistency in the format of the same address as Customer 101.
- **Customer 103**: The **Zip Code** is "1105" instead of "01105," showing inconsistency in the zip code format (missing leading zero).

Inconsistent data like this creates confusion and inefficiencies, as different systems may not recognize the same entity when information is presented in various formats. This can lead to duplicate records or incorrect data processing.

### Example of Timelessness Issue

Hereâs an example of a **data timeliness issue** using the customer list:

| Customer ID | First Name | Last Name | Address        | City         | Zip Code | Last Updated |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| 101         | John       | Smith     | 123 Elm St     | Springfield  | 01105    | 2024-09-01   |
| 102         | Jane       | Doe       | 456 Oak Ave    | Shelbyville  | 12345    | 2024-09-01   |
| 103         | Jonh       | Smtih     | 123 Elm Street | Springfield  | 01105    | 2021-06-15   |
| 104         | Emma       | Johnson   | 789 Maple Blvd | Capital City | 54321    | 2022-03-10   |

**Timeliness Issues**:

- **Customer 103**: The **Last Updated** date is from 2021, making this record outdated. Since the address and contact details haven't been verified or updated in over two years, it's possible that the data is no longer accurate.
- **Customer 104**: The data was last updated in early 2022, which also makes it outdated for a customer who might have changed address or contact information since then.

Outdated records like these could lead to problems such as sending communications or deliveries to the wrong address, missing customer preferences, or failing to capture changes that impact business decisions. Timely data updates are crucial to maintaining the reliability of customer information.

### Example of Validity Issue

Hereâs an example of a **data validity issue** using the customer list:

| Customer ID | First Name | Last Name | Address        | City         | Zip Code | Email                 |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | --------------------- |
| 101         | John       | Smith     | 123 Elm St     | Springfield  | 01105    | john.smith@email.com  |
| 102         | Jane       | Doe       | 456 Oak Ave    | Shelbyville  | 12345    | jane.doe@email.com    |
| 103         | Jonh       | Smtih     | 123 Elm Street | Springfield  | 1105     | jonh.smtih@email..com |
| 104         | Emma       | Johnson   | 789 Maple Blvd | Capital City | 54321    | emma@invalidemail@com |

**Validity Issues**:

- **Customer 103**: The email address "jonh.smtih@email..com" contains a formatting error (extra period before ".com"), which is invalid.
- **Customer 104**: The email "emma@invalidemail@com" has two "@" symbols, which is not allowed in email formatting, making it invalid.

In cases like these, data validity rules (e.g., proper email formats, correct zip code length, or valid data types) must be enforced. Invalid data such as incorrect email formats could result in failed communications and missed customer interactions, highlighting the importance of ensuring data conforms to required standards.

### Example for Uniqueness Issue

Hereâs an example of a **data uniqueness issue** using the customer list:

| Customer ID | First Name | Last Name | Address        | City         | Zip Code | Email                  |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------------------- |
| 101         | John       | Smith     | 123 Elm St     | Springfield  | 01105    | john.smith@email.com   |
| 102         | Jane       | Doe       | 456 Oak Ave    | Shelbyville  | 12345    | jane.doe@email.com     |
| 103         | Jonh       | Smtih     | 123 Elm Street | Springfield  | 01105    | jonh.smtih@email.com   |
| 104         | Emma       | Johnson   | 789 Maple Blvd | Capital City | 54321    | emma.johnson@email.com |
| 105         | John       | Smith     | 123 Elm St     | Springfield  | 01105    | john.smith@email.com   |

**Uniqueness Issues**:

- **Customer 101 and Customer 105**: These entries are duplicates, representing the same individual (John Smith) with identical information (address, email, etc.). However, they have different **Customer IDs**, which indicates a lack of uniqueness in the dataset.

Duplicate records like this can lead to inefficiencies, such as multiple mailings to the same person, errors in customer segmentation, and skewed analytics. Ensuring uniqueness, especially in key fields like Customer ID or email, is crucial to maintaining data integrity.

### Example of Integrity Issues

Hereâs an example of a **data integrity issue** using a customer list and an associated order table:

**Customer Table**:
| Customer ID | First Name | Last Name | Address | City | Zip Code |
|-------------|------------|-----------|------------------|--------------|-----------|
| 101 | John | Smith | 123 Elm St | Springfield | 01105 |
| 102 | Jane | Doe | 456 Oak Ave | Shelbyville | 12345 |
| 103 | Jonh | Smtih | 123 Elm Street | Springfield | 01105 |
| 104 | Emma | Johnson | 789 Maple Blvd | Capital City | 54321 |

**Order Table**:
| Order ID | Customer ID | Order Date | Order Amount |
|----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| 5001 | 101 | 2024-09-01 | $150 |
| 5002 | 105 | 2024-09-02 | $200 |
| 5003 | 104 | 2024-09-03 | $250 |

**Integrity Issues**:

- **Customer ID in Order Table**: In the Order Table, **Order 5002** refers to **Customer ID 105**, which does not exist in the **Customer Table**. This indicates a **referential integrity** problem, where a record in the Order Table is pointing to a non-existent customer.
- **Mismatch of Addresses**: In the Customer Table, **Customer 103** has the same address as **Customer 101** but with variations (e.g., "Elm Street" vs. "Elm St."), which could also indicate an integrity issue in maintaining consistent data relationships.

Data integrity ensures that relationships between tables (e.g., customer and order data) are accurate and complete. Integrity issues like these can lead to broken reporting, incorrect data analysis, and operational inefficiencies.

### Multiple Data Quality Dimensions Issues

A single issue, like an address problem, can involve **multiple data quality dimensions** at once. Here's how:

1. **Accuracy**: if the address is wrong (e.g., "123 Elm St" instead of "321 Elm St"), itâs an accuracy issue. This can cause real problems, like sending packages to the wrong place or communicating with the customer at the wrong address.
2. **Completeness**: if part of the address is missing, such as no zip code or an incomplete street name (e.g., âElm Stâ without the house number), thatâs a completeness issue. Without the full details, the address may not be useful, and the business can't function properly.
3. **Integrity**: data integrity is about making sure information is consistent across systems. If one system shows "123 Elm St" and another has "456 Oak Ave" for the same person, itâs an integrity problem, as these records don't match.

So, a simple issue like an incorrect or incomplete address can affect **accuracy**, **completeness**, and **integrity** all at the same time, making it crucial to fix the issue from multiple angles to ensure the data is reliable.

## Data Quality Rules

The **Data Quality Rules**, also called **Data Validation Rules**, are guidelines that defines what **good data** looks like. They specify the conditions data must meet to be accurate, complete, consistent and usable for its purpose.

The Data Quality rules are the technical implementation of the Business rules designed to meet stakeholders' expectations for reliable, consistent and useful data. They ensure that the data supports both business operations and decision-making effectively.

### What?

The following rules make sure the data stays useful and trustworthy.

- **Clear and Specific**: the rules clearly define what **good data** looks like, like "every email must included an @ symbol".
- **Relevant**: The rules are based on what matters for your business or how the data will be used.
- **Helpful**: The rules make it easy to spot and fix issues when data doesn't meet the standards.
- **Automatic**: The rules can be applied using tools or scripts to regularly check the data.

### Examples of Data Quality Rules

- **Completeness rules**: No important fields should be empty (e.g., every customer must have an email address).
- **Uniqueness rule**: No duplicates (e.g., every OrderID must be unique).
- **Accuracy rule**: Data should match real-world values (e.g., a zip code must match its city).
- **Consistency rule**: Related data should align across systems (e.g., a user status should be the same in all databases).
- **Validity rule**: Data should follow rules or formats (e.g., dates must be in `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Timeliness**: Data should be up-to-date (e.g., transaction must be processed within 24 hours).

### Why?

These rules help identify errors, maintain trust in the data, and ensure it's useful for decision-making and compliance. They are checklist to keep the data clean and reliable.

### How to define the Data Quality Rules

#### The step-by-step process

The following is a simplified process to define the Data Quality Rules, step by step.

1. Understanding the data and its purpose
   - Why is the data is used? Understand its role in business process, reports or decision-making.
   - Who uses it? Identify key stakeholders and their expectations for the data.
2. Identify common issues
   - Review the data for frequent errors (e.g., duplicates, missing fields, invalid formats, etc.).
   - Gather feedback from users about problems they encounter.
3. Define key data quality dimensions
   - Focus on aspects like:
     - Completeness: are all required fields filed?
     - Accuracy: is the data correct and reliable?
     - Consistency: does it match across systems?
     - Timeliness: is it up-to-date?
     - Uniqueness: are there any duplicates?
4. Write rules that address the issues you've identified. Make them clear and actionable. E.g.:
   - Customer email not be empty.
   - Order IDs must be unique.
   - Dates must follow the format YYYY-MM-DD.
5. Validate and Test the Rules
   - Apply the rules to sample data to ensure they work as intended.
   - Involve stakeholders to confirm the rules align with the business needs.
6. Automate and monitor
   - Implement the rules in tools like ETL processes, data validation scripts, or monitoring systems.
   - Set up alerts to flag issues when data doesn't meet the rules.
7. Review and Improve
   - Regularly review the rules to keep them relevant as business needs and data evolve.
   - Incorporate new feedback and insights over time.

All the above steps and process ensure that the data quality rules are practical relevant and effective.

#### Example

This example is using previous section defined table, but some errors were added to the email column. The example will only focus on the email column, but this process should be applied to all columns.

| Customer ID | First Name | Last Name | Email                 |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| 101         | John       | Smith     | john.smith@email.com  |
| 102         | Jane       | Doe       | jane.doe@email.com    |
| 103         | Jonh       | Smtih     | jonh.smtih@email..com |
| 104         | Emma       | Johnson   | emma@invalidemail@com |

Bellow is the analysis of the table data using the previously defined step-by-step process.

1. Understanding the Data and its purpose
   - Why is the data used?
     - The email addresses are used for customer communication, such a sensing invoices, marketing emails, and the account notifications.
   - Who uses it?
     - The key stakeholders include the sales team (for promotions), the customer support team (for communication), and the marketing team (for campaigns).
2. Identify common issues
   - Review the data issues:
     - Invalid email formats (e.g., `jonh.smtih@email..com` or `emma@invalidemail@com`).
     - Missing or empty email fields.
     - Duplicate emails, which can cause communication errors.
   - Gather feedback
     - Marketing and customer support report failed email deliveries due to incorrect email formats.
3. Define key Data Quality dimensions
   - Completeness: all customers must have an email address
   - Accuracy: emails must follow the standard email format (e.g., `username@domain.com`).
   - Uniqueness: email address should not be duplicated across records.
   - Consistency: email format chould match the expected syntax and avoid errors (e.g., no multiple `@` or `..`).
   - Timeliness: email address should be updated regularly if customers change them.
4. Write rules to address the issues
   - Rule 1: email addresses must not be empty or null.
   - Rule 2: email addresses must follow the pattern `username@domain.com`.
   - Rule 3: each email must be unique across all customer records.
   - Rule 4: emails should not contain consecutive dots (e.g., `..`) or multiple `@` symbol.
5. Validate and test the rules
   - Apply to sample data:
     - `john.smith@email.com` â Pass.
     - `jonh.smtih@email..com` â Fail (double dot).
     - `emma@invalidemail@com` â Fail (multiple `@`).
   - Confirm with marketing and support teams that these rules align with their expectations and address their reported issues.
6. Automate and monitor
   - Implement these rules in a data pipeline or validation tools:
     - ETL: add a validation step (or task) to check email format, uniqueness and completeness.
     - Alerts: setup monitoring to flag invalid or missing emails, during data ingestion.
   - Automation:
     - Use a regex pattern to validate email formats: `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$.`
     - Deduplicate email addresses with a database query or script.
7. Review and improve
   - Regular reviews:
     - Periodically audit email addresses for new issues (e.g., obsolete domains, or temporary email services, etc).
   - Feedback loop:
     - Collect input from stakeholders about any new challenges, like domain-specific formatting quirks or newly encountered delivery failures.

By following this process, the email column remains clean, valid and reliable for all stakeholders and business needs. The following code block in an example of **Great Expectations** script for the email column data validation according to the defined rules:

```python
from great_expectations.dataset import PandasDataset
import pandas as pd

# Table transformed into a dataframe, for example purpose only.
data = {
    "Customer ID": [101, 102, 103, 104],
    "First Name": ["John", "Jane", "Jonh", "Emma"],
    "Last Name": ["Smith", "Doe", "Smtih", "Johnson"],
    "Email": [
        "john.smith@email.com",
        "jane.doe@email.com",
        "jonh.smtih@email..com",
        "emma@invalidemail@com"
    ]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
dataset = PandasDataset(df)

# Define Great Expectations validations

# Rule 1: Email must not be null or empty
result_not_null = dataset.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null("Email")
print("Rule 1 - Not Null Result:", result_not_null)

# Rule 2: Email must match the standard email pattern
email_regex = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
result_valid_format = dataset.expect_column_values_to_match_regex("Email", email_regex)
print("Rule 2 - Valid Format Result:", result_valid_format)

# Rule 3: Email addresses must be unique
result_unique = dataset.expect_column_values_to_be_unique("Email")
print("Rule 3 - Unique Result:", result_unique)
```

The script output should look like:

```console
Rule 1 - Not Null Result: {'success': True, 'result': {'unexpected_count': 0, ...}}
Rule 2 - Valid Format Result: {'success': False, 'result': {'unexpected_list': ['jonh.smtih@email..com', 'emma@invalidemail@com'], ...}}
Rule 3 - Unique Result: {'success': True, 'result': {'unexpected_count': 0, ...}}
```

This ensure that the email data meets the defined quality rules and flags issues for further review or correction. These expectations can be integrated into a **Great Expectations** validation suite for the **Automation and monitoring** step.

## Data Quality Techniques

### Data Profiling

The **Data Profiling** is the process of analyzing and understanding the structure, content, and quality within a dataset. It involves examining the data to uncover insights, patterns, anomalies, and potential issues. It is helping organizations assess its fitness for use in decision making, reporting an other purposes.

#### What?

The following are the main aspects of Data Profiling:

1. Structure analysis: identifying the format, schema, and types of data (e.g., columns, data types and constraints).
   - Example: ensuring column expected to hold dates contains valid date formats.
2. Content analysis: examining the actual values in the data to detect patterns, distributions, or outliers.
   - Example: checking the range of values in `zip code` colum to ensure validity.
3. Quality Assessment: assessing dimensions like completeness, uniqueness, consistency, and accuracy.
   - Example: identifying duplicate records or null values in critical fields.
4. Relationships and dependencies: Evaluating relationships between columns or datasets, such as foreign key dependencies.
   - Example: ensuring `Customer ID` is one table matches valid entries in a `Customer Details` table.

#### Why?

Why Data Profiling is so important? Because it plays a crucial role in improving data quality by identifying errors, inconsistencies, and gaps that require correction. It support decision-making by ensuring that decisions are based on reliable and accurate data. Additionally, data profiling enhances data integration by preparing datasets for merging or transformation in ETL pipelines. It also facilitates compliance by ensuring that data meets regulatory or business requirements.

#### Example

Results from a Data Profiling investigation would return this, as an example:

- 5% of `Email` fields are null.
- 3% of `Phone Numbers` are in incorrect format.
- 10% of the customers share duplicate entries.

This report or information will help to guide the following actions in order to clean and standardize the data.

#### Who?

Who would benefit of data profiling? It would benefit to anyone relying on accurate, reliable data. **Data Analysts and Scientists** use it to prepare clean datasets for analysis or modeling. **Data Engineers and Database Administrators** leverage it to maintain ETL pipelines and database health. **BI teams and Business Stakeholders** gain trusts in reports and decisions. **Compliance teams** use it to ensure regulatory adherence, while the **Data Governance teams** enforce quality standards. Even **Developers** benefit by validating data used in applications. In essence, data profiling ensures data quality for all roles across an organization.

### Data Parsing

**Data Parsing** is the process of breaking down raw data into smaller, more manageable components to extract meaningful information and organize it for further processing or analysis. Parsing often involves converting unstructured or semi-structured data into a structured format that can be easily understood and utilized by systems or humans.

#### What?

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Input] --> B[Process] --> C[Output]
```

The following is the flow of the Data Parsing:

- **Input**: takes raw data (e.g., text files, JSON, XML, logs, or database entries).
- **Process**: Analyzes and splits the data into defined parts or fields based on specific rules or patterns.
- **Output**: Produces structured data, such as rows and columns in a table, or a well-formed JSON object,

#### Examples

The following are real life **Data Parsing** examples:

- **Log Files**: parsing a log file to extract timestamps, error codes, and messages form system logs.
- **JSON and XML files**: parsing a JSON or XML file to break down hierarchical data into key:value pairs or relational tables.
- **Text**: parsing text or string like `jon snow, jon.snow@doomain.com, 555-123-4567`into separate fields, for example `name`, `email` and `phone`.

#### Why?

The **Data Parsing** is important because it prepares raw data for analysis, storage or precessing. It is enabling systems to handle large dataset efficiently. It also ensure data is standardized, making it consistent and usable across different platform and applications.

### Data Standardization

The **Data Standardization** is the process of transforming data into a consistent format to ensure uniformity and compatibility across different systems, datasets, or applications.It involves applying predefined rules to align data structure, naming conventions, units, format and values, making the data easier to integrate, analyze and interpret.

#### What?

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Raw Data] --> B[Standardized Data]
```

The main aspects of the Data Standardization include:

- **Consistent Formats**: aligns data format, e.g., dates as `YYYY-MM-DD`, phone as `+1-555-123-4567`.
- **Uniform Units**: convert measurements to standard unit, e.g., miles to kilometers, Fahrenheit to Celsius, etc.
- **Naming Conventions**: ensures uniform naming for fields or categories, e.g., `Customer ID` instead of `CustID` or `C_ID`.
- **Value Alignment**: maps synonyms or variations to a single value, e.g., all the values `US`, `USA` and `United States` would be standardized to `United States`.

#### Examples

The following are some examples:

| Raw Data           | Standardized Data         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| DOB: 12-31-2020    | Date of Birth: 2020-12-31 |
| Country: us        | Country: United States    |
| Height: 5 ft 10 in | Height: 70 inches         |

#### How?

The identity resolution process looks as the following:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Identify] --> B[Connect] --> C[Match] --> D[Validate] --> E[Activate]
```

Where each phase are defined as the following:

- **Identify**: channels, platforms and devices.
- **Connect**: connect the dots between the different channels, platforms and devices.
- **Match**: based on a defined set of attributes (e.g., same household, IP, WiFi network, timing patterns, etc).
- **Validate**: validate that it's the samxe identity.
- **Activate**: create a single, data rich profile

#### Example

| Raw Records                                                  | Resolved Identity                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Record 1: John Smith, john.smith@email.com, 123 Elm St.      | Unified profile: John Smith, Emails: [john.smith@email.com, john.smith123@email.com], Address: 123 Elm Street. |
| Record 2: J. Smith, john.smith123@email.com, 123 Elm Street. |                                                                                                                |

#### Why?

The Identity Resolution is important because it provides a unified view of a customers, enabling personalized interactions and improving the overall customer experience. By reducing duplicates and inconsistencies across datasets, ite enhance data quality and ensures that records are accurate and reliable. It also plays a critical role in fraud detection by linking related records to identify suspicious activity.

    Policy["Data Governance Policy"] --> Principles["Principles"]
    Principles --> Dimensions["Measured by Data Quality Dimensions"]
```

#### Policy

The Data Governance Policy is a formal document approved by senior management as part of the organization's **Information Governance Mandate**. It sets the foundation for how data is governed, communicated, and enforced across all levels of the business.

#### Principles

The policy breaks down into a set of guiding principles that define the mindset and expectations around data governance, grouped according to Seinerâs color-coded model:

#### Data as a Strategic Enterprise Asset

- **Data is a strategic enterprise asset**: Data must be recognized as valuable to the organization.
- **From "my data" to "our data"**: Shifting the mindset from departmental ownership to shared organizational responsibility.

#### Defined Accountability

- **Everyone is responsible for data governance**: All employees have a role in handling data appropriately.
- **Clear accountability**: Formalize who is responsible for what data and ensure responsibilities are understood and followed.

#### Compliance and Risk Management

- **Compliance**: Ensure data use aligns with internal policies and external regulations.
- **Avoid risk and compliance issues**: Prevent legal and operational issues by applying governance consistently.

#### Data Quality and Consistency

- **Consistent data quality**: Define and maintain data quality standards across the data lifecycle.
- **First time right, every time**: Ensure processes are designed to get data right from the start.

#### Dimensions

To measure the success of data governance, the following core data quality dimensions are monitored:

- **Accessibility** â Is the data available to authorized users?
- **Accuracy** â Is the data correct and trustworthy?
- **Completeness** â Is any data missing?
- **Consistency** â Does the data match across systems?
- **Relevance (non-obsolete)** â Is the data current and meaningful?
- **Timeliness** â Is the data available when needed?
- **Uniqueness** â Are there any duplicates or unnecessary copies?

#### In a Nutshell

Seinerâs approach to data governance policy is built around the idea of recognizing and organizing what is already happening in the business. The policy defines how to guide and measure data governance, encourages shared responsibility, and ensures data is managed safely and effectively without disrupting day-to-day operations.
